# usman1-FeelsBook
Assignment 1 for CMPUT 301 Fall 2018 -- Muhammad Usman

FeelsBook lets you quickly record your feelings throughout the day, and displays a history of all past emotions. For record-keeping purposes, FeelsBook records the date of the entered feeling and allows an optional, brief comment. Both the date and comment may be edited. A counter for each feeling is kept to indicate the most recurring emotions in your life.
